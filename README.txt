Compile the file with opencv dependencies.
opencv libraries used - opencv_core
						opencv_imgproc
						opencv_imgcodecs
						opencv_highgui

Run- <program_name> <file_path>

The program can succesfully detect the roi of the code but since the image can be multiplaner 
we can't use warpPerspective or similar kind of perspective correction methods. beacause warpPerspective works
with 4 co-ordinates point of the roi. but in multi planer image we need correct multiple point of the image
to get the correct perspective. So we need to use some other methods where we can do multipoint perspective correction.

I have tried to find if this can be done with any other method but couldn't abled.
